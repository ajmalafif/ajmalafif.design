One of my life goals is to create a fulfilling and balanced lifestyle, and extend it to people I love and care the most.

I went to Pennsylvania State University, State College for college and have a degree in Actuarial Science.

Ever since I found my passion few years back, I have never stop learning and never intend to. So for 2018, here is my ongoing list of things to learn.

Iâ€™m a UI/UX Designer with 8 years experience as a frontend developer. I spend most of my leisure time learning new things that are foreign and new to me.

I see myself as a journeyman that is always pursuing mastery by putting my knowledge into practice. I believe the best way to learn is by doing and also teaching.
